# Pro Court Surfaces - Marketing Site

## Project Goal
Landing page targeting GC estimators in Central Texas who are searching for a sport court surfacing subcontractor. The site should convert visitors like Matt (see `persona.md`) into bid requests via the quote form.

## Key Objectives
- Rank for SEO and AEO on terms like "sport court subcontractor central texas"
- Address GC skepticism about subcontractor reliability head-on
- Drive conversions to the quote request form
- Showcase ATS Sports Acrytech as a premium, PPA-approved surface system

## Tech Stack
- **Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript** — no frameworks, no build step
- Single `index.html` file with inline styles and scripts
- Deployed to Vercel via CLI (`vercel --prod`)
- Live at https://cc-class-site.vercel.app

## Copywriting Rules
- **Always read `persona.md` before writing or editing any copy** — every word should speak to Matt's priorities
- Use GC/estimator language: "bids", "callbacks", "change orders", "closeout", "carrying costs"
- Never sound like a homeowner-facing site — this is B2B, contractor-to-contractor
- Keep it direct and confident — no fluff, no marketing buzzwords

## Key Files
- `index.html` — the entire site (markup, styles, scripts)
- `persona.md` — target buyer persona (Matt at Fazzon Construction)
- `prd.md` — ROI calculator product requirements
