*Generated February 2026*

## Top 5 Competitors

### 1. CourTex Construction — **#1 THREAT**

- **Website:** https://courtexconstruction.com
- **HQ:** Leander, TX (direct Central Texas overlap)
- **Surface Systems:** ATS Acrytech, SnapSports, Cushion X, Pro Cushion
- **Coverage:** TX (Austin, Dallas, Houston, SA), Colorado, Carolinas
- **Target Market:** Residential + commercial. No GC sub positioning.
- **Experience:** 15+ years, post-tension concrete expertise
- **Pricing:** Quote-based, not published
- **Warranty:** Not disclosed publicly

**Positioning:** "WE. BUILD. COURTS." — full-service court builder (concrete through surfacing). Broad, not niche.

**Strengths:**
- Installs the **same Acrytech system** — direct product overlap
- Multi-state presence signals scale and credibility
- Strong SEO with location-specific pages
- Commercial facility experience

**Weaknesses:**
- Zero GC-specific messaging — talks to end clients, not estimators
- No multi-family or amenity center focus
- Full-service model means they compete with GCs on base work (concrete) rather than complementing them
- Generic "court builder" positioning — not specialized

**Messaging Gap:** They don't speak to estimators. An estimator landing on their site sees a company selling to property owners, not a sub ready to plug into a GC's workflow.

### 2. KMS Sport Surfaces

- **Website:** https://kmssportsurfaces.com
- **HQ:** Houston, TX (offices in Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio)
- **Surface Systems:** Generic "high-performance non-skid acrylic" — no named brand
- **Coverage:** Statewide Texas (4 regional offices)
- **Target Market:** Residential + institutional (schools, universities, sports clubs)
- **Experience:** 35+ years (est. 1990), 1,200+ courts
- **Pricing:** "Affordable" positioning, not published
- **Warranty:** Not disclosed publicly
- **Certifications:** BBB, ASBA, USTA

**Positioning:** "Affordable Sports Surfaces Construction and Repair" — budget-conscious, high-volume.

**Strengths:**
- Longest track record in the market (since 1990)
- ASBA and USTA certifications add credibility
- Four Texas offices = genuine statewide coverage
- 1,200+ courts is hard to argue with

**Weaknesses:**
- Gmail email address (kmstenniscourts@gmail.com) undercuts the professional image
- "Affordable" positioning conflicts with quality-first buyers like Matt
- No named surface brand — harder to verify product quality
- Zero GC or multi-family messaging

**Messaging Gap:** They sell on price. Matt doesn't buy on price — he buys on quality and reliability. Their "affordable" angle actually works in our favor: we can position against the "cheap sub" archetype.

### 3. Aguilar Athletic Services

- **Website:** https://www.aguilarathletics.com
- **HQ:** Houston, TX (serves statewide including Austin, SA, Waco)
- **Surface Systems:** Plexipave acrylic surfacing (competitor to Acrytech)
- **Coverage:** Houston-based, statewide TX ambitions (12+ metros listed)
- **Target Market:** Residential + commercial (schools, HOAs, country clubs, resorts, hotels)
- **Experience:** 23+ years combined, 500+ projects, "40-year family legacy"
- **Pricing:** Not published. Payment: 30% down / 50% at pour / 20% at completion. Dick's gift card promo ($500 for new builds)
- **Warranty:** **5 years (new builds), 3 years (resurfacing)** — most transparent in market

**Positioning:** "Passion, Play, and Purpose: Paved to Perfection" — family-founded, personal service.

**Strengths:**
- **Best warranty transparency in the market** (5yr build / 3yr resurface)
- HOA and hospitality segments — closest to multi-family positioning
- Transparent payment structure (useful info for estimators)
- Statewide ambition with 12+ metros

**Weaknesses:**
- Pandemic-era startup — less established track record
- Houston-centric despite statewide claims
- Dick's gift card promo feels consumer-grade, not B2B
- No GC subcontractor messaging at all
- Plexipave is less well-known than Acrytech

**Messaging Gap:** Their warranty is better than ours on paper (5yr vs 2yr). But they don't target GCs — an estimator would have to dig to find relevant info. Their consumer promos would actually turn off a professional estimator.

### 4. Build My Courts

- **Website:** https://buildmycourts.com
- **HQ:** Houston, TX (expanding into Austin/SA)
- **Surface Systems:** Not disclosed — appears brand-agnostic
- **Coverage:** Houston (primary), Dallas, Austin, San Antonio
- **Target Market:** Residential + HOA + commercial
- **Experience:** 300+ custom courts (1,000+ claimed across Texas)
- **Pricing:** Consultation-based, not published
- **Warranty:** Not disclosed publicly

**Positioning:** "Houston's Trusted Sport Court Experts" — reputation and volume.

**Strengths:**
- Strong review presence (4.5+ stars on Google)
- Named commercial clients (Lifetime Fitness)
- Growing Austin/SA presence
- Full-service: concrete, surfacing, striping, lighting, fencing

**Weaknesses:**
- Houston-centric — Austin/SA presence is secondary
- No specific surface brand = harder to differentiate on quality
- Full-service model = scope overlap with GC trades (concrete, fencing, lighting)
- Heavy JavaScript site = potential SEO weakness
- Zero GC subcontractor positioning

**Messaging Gap:** Full-service is their strength but our opportunity. A GC doesn't want a sub doing fencing AND surfacing AND lighting — that's scope creep. Our "surfacing only, zero overlap" message directly counters their model.

### 5. Sport Court of Austin

- **Website:** https://www.sportcourtofaustin.com
- **HQ:** Austin, TX (10208 HWY 620 N)
- **Surface Systems:** Sport Court modular tile system (NOT acrylic surfacing)
- **Coverage:** Austin and Central Texas
- **Target Market:** Residential families + institutional (schools, Boys & Girls Clubs)
- **Experience:** Since 1978 — 47+ years. First pickleball court in Austin.
- **Pricing:** Custom quotes, not published
- **Warranty:** Listed but details not public

**Positioning:** Legacy Austin brand, safety-focused, community-oriented.

**Strengths:**
- **Longest operating in Austin** (since 1978) — unmatched local brand recognition
- FIBA-approved surfaces
- Portfolio includes Collier Apartments (Pflugerville) — actual amenity center work
- ISO 9001/14001 certified

**Weaknesses:**
- Modular tile system, NOT acrylic — fundamentally different product
- Residential-first messaging and branding
- Legacy brand but aging web presence
- No GC subcontractor positioning

**Messaging Gap:** Different product entirely (tiles vs. acrylic), but they have brand recognition in Austin. A GC might default to calling them because they're the name they know — even though modular tiles aren't ideal for permanent amenity center installations.

## Pro Court Surfaces' Strategic Advantages

### 1. Only GC subcontractor in Central Texas
Not a single competitor positions as a surfacing sub for general contractors. Every competitor talks to end clients. Pro Court Surfaces owns this lane completely.

### 2. Clean scope = no trade conflict
CourTex and Build My Courts offer full-service (concrete, fencing, lighting, surfacing). This creates scope overlap and potential conflict with other trades on a GC's project. Pro Court's "surfacing only" model is a feature, not a limitation.

### 3. Acrytech in Central Texas
Only CourTex also installs Acrytech locally, and they don't target GCs. Master Systems (DFW) is too far north. Pro Court is the only Acrytech-focused, GC-facing option in Central Texas.

### 4. Multi-family amenity centers are uncontested
Nobody is explicitly marketing to the multi-family amenity center segment. Sport Court of Austin has one apartment project. Aguilar mentions HOAs. But nobody owns this niche.

### 5. Estimator-specific messaging
No competitor speaks the language of a GC estimator (bids, callbacks, change orders, carrying costs, closeout packages). The entire market talks to property owners and facilities managers.

## Vulnerabilities to Address

1. **Warranty gap:** Aguilar offers 5yr/3yr. Our 2-year workmanship warranty is below their published terms. Consider whether pushing to match or exceed is feasible, or lean harder on the Acrytech manufacturer warranty as the real coverage.

2. **Track record / social proof:** CourTex has 15+ years, KMS has 35+ years, Build My Courts has 1,000+ courts. Pro Court Surfaces needs to build visible credibility fast — project photos, testimonials from GCs, and named clients on the site.

3. **CourTex is the one to watch.** Same product (Acrytech), same geography (Leander), and they have scale. If they ever pivot to GC subcontracting, they'd be a direct threat. Beat them to market dominance in this lane.

4. **SEO competition is real.** CourTex has location-specific pages across multiple cities. KMS has 4 office locations that generate local SEO signals. Pro Court needs strong local SEO for Central Texas search terms.

## Messaging Gaps to Exploit

| Gap | Opportunity for Pro Court |
|---|---|
| No one speaks to GC estimators | Own the "subcontractor for GCs" positioning entirely |
| No one addresses sub-contractor skepticism | "Straight Talk" section on our site already does this — double down |
| No one publishes bid turnaround times | "48-hour detailed bid" is a differentiator worth repeating |
| Warranty info is hidden industry-wide | Be transparent about our 2yr + manufacturer warranty |
| No one talks about closeout documentation | GCs need warranty docs for project closeout — we provide them |
| Multi-family amenity centers are unclaimed | Own this keyword and segment before competitors notice |
| "Affordable" competitors create a foil | Our ROI calculator already makes the case against cheap subs |
