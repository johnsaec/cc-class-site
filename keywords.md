# Keyword Strategy: Pro Court Surfaces

*Generated February 2026 — DataForSEO Google Ads API (Texas geo-targeted)*

---

## Strategy Summary

Pro Court Surfaces has a **massive uncontested lane**: no competitor positions as a GC subcontractor. The keyword strategy targets two layers:

1. **Primary (GC/estimator intent)** — Zero indexed volume, but exact-match for Matt's search behavior. These are the money keywords.
2. **Secondary (court surfacing intent)** — Modest Texas volume with low competition. Win these by being the only result with GC-relevant content.

**Important:** All volumes below are **Texas-only** monthly searches, not national. This is your actual addressable market.

## Tier 1: Priority Keywords (GC/Sub Intent — Uncontested)

These keywords match Matt's actual search behavior. They show 0 volume in Google Ads because the audience is hyper-niche — but conversion intent is near 100%. **No competitor ranks for these.**

| Keyword | TX Vol | Competition | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| sport court subcontractor | 0 | None indexed | Exact match for what Matt searches. Zero competition. |
| pickleball court subcontractor | 0 | None indexed | GC sub framing — nobody else uses this language |
| court surfacing subcontractor | 0 | None indexed | B2B sub positioning, no competitors here |
| amenity center court surfacing | 0 | None indexed | Multi-family specific, unclaimed by all 5 competitors |
| court surfacing bid | 0 | None indexed | Estimator intent — looking to get a bid |
| court surfacing central texas | 0 | None indexed | Geo + service, uncontested |

**Action:** Zero Google Ads volume doesn't mean zero searches — it means Google can't measure them yet. These are the queries Matt types. Own them through on-page content, schema markup, and AEO. When Matt searches, you should be the only relevant result.

## Tier 2: High-Value Surfacing Keywords (Texas Volume + Winnable)

## Tier 2B: Geo-Specific Keywords (Location Pages)

Most geo-specific keywords show 0-10/mo in Texas — but they're critical for "near me" and local pack results.

| Keyword | TX Vol/mo | Comp | CPC | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tennis court resurfacing austin | 10 | LOW | $0.00 | Location page target |
| tennis court resurfacing san antonio | 10 | HIGH | $23.27 | High CPC = buyer intent. Location page. |
| tennis court repair austin | 10 | N/A | $0.00 | Location page target |
| pickleball court installer austin | 0 | N/A | — | Unindexed but people search this. Location page. |
| court resurfacing austin | 0 | N/A | — | Location page target |
| sport court surfacing austin | 0 | N/A | — | Location page target |
| pickleball court installer san antonio | 0 | N/A | — | Location page target |

**Action:** Build location-specific pages for Austin, San Antonio, Round Rock, Georgetown, Cedar Park. Even at 0-10/mo each, the combined cluster adds up — and these dominate Google's local pack.

## Tier 3: Content Marketing Keywords (Texas Volume)

Use these for blog posts and guides that attract GCs researching options.

| Keyword | TX Vol/mo | Comp | CPC | Content Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cost of tennis court construction | 260 | LOW | $12.42 | "Court Construction Cost Guide for Texas GCs" |
| basketball court flooring | 210 | HIGH | $5.68 | "Amenity Center Flooring: Acrylic vs. Tile vs. Rubber" |

| cost to install a pickleball court | 10 | MEDIUM | $36.02 | **$36 CPC!** Tiny volume but extreme buyer intent. FAQ content. |

---

## Tier 4: Avoid or Deprioritize

| Keyword | TX Vol | Why Skip |
|---|---|---|
| sport court tiles / floor tiles | 170/mo | Modular tile product — Sport Court of Austin's lane, not acrylic |
| basketball court tiles | 110/mo | Tile intent, not surfacing |
| asphalt basketball court | 170/mo | DIY/homeowner, not commercial |
| outdoor basketball court flooring | 110/mo | Consumer product searches |
| wood basketball flooring | 70/mo | Indoor gym, irrelevant |
| versacourt / sportmaster branded | 20-40/mo | Competitor brand names — don't chase |
